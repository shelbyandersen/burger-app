## Description

This project utilizes MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a homegrown ORM to accomplish the following:

- A user can type a burger name and submit it. The burger app will display the burger on the left side of the page waiting to be devoured

- Each burger on the left side of the page has a `Devour It` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page

- The burgers are stored in a database, whether devoured or not

# Installation

The code for the Burger App can be found on github using the following link:

- https://github.com/shelbyandersen/burger-app

# Usage

The Burger App uses Node, Express, MySQL, Handlebars, and a homemade ORM to create and store data for the application.

The database schema contains a burgers table:

- **burgers**:

  - **id** - INT PRIMARY KEY
  - **name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold burger name
  - **isDevoured** - BOOLEAN

  The `orm.js` file creates the methods that will execute the necessary MySQL commands in the controllers. These methods are used to retrieve and store data in the database.
